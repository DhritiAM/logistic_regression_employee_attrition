# Logistic Regression for Employee Attrition Prediction

This project explores predicting employee attrition using logistic regression. It covers data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation with intuitive visualizations.

## Project Overview

Key aspects covered:

1. Data preprocessing: Handling categorical and numerical variables, missing values, and feature scaling.

2. Feature selection: Identifying the most important predictors of attrition.

3. Modeling: Logistic Regression for binary classification (Leave / Stay).

4. Evaluation metrics: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve.

5. Insights: How threshold choices affect sensitivity and specificity, and practical business implications.

## Key Learnings

* No single metric defines model performance â€” accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and thresholds all matter.
* Feature selection and preprocessing significantly impact model effectiveness.
* Understanding business context (e.g., sensitivity vs. specificity) is crucial in interpreting predictions.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve data preprocessing, visualizations or any changes to improve performance.
